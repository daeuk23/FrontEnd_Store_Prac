      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>First of all, I would like to briefly explain Responsive Design &amp; Relevance to web technology, 
         And I will explain the building web for devices into research by dividing to each items, 
         and at the end, I will summarize the facts learned through the course.
         <ul class="reponsive">
          <li>
            <h3>&lt;What is Responsive Design&gt;</h3>
            <p>
              Responsive design is a type of design technology that uses design technology to automatically adjust the screen size and layout to the type of device. 
              Simply put, the screen size varies depending on the type of device, so it is a technology that sets and displays each screen 
              at a different size &lpar;size appropriate for the device&rpar;. The layout and images are flexibly adjusted depending on the situation,
              eliminating disadvantages such as space left over, and have the advantage of maintaining consistency regardless of device. 
              In general, it is said that it is designed based on “mobile” screens with small screens and sets how it will change depending on the larger screen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>&lt;Relevance to web technology&gt;</h3>
            <p>Responsive design impacts many areas in the web development world. In addition to simply setting different display sizes depending on the situation
               through max-width in CSS that sets the display. Even in the js framework, detailed items such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; can be adjusted, 
                and various display elements such as layout must be directly specified during web development. 
                Therefore, the “use” of responsive design is considered the domain of web technologies. It is also an essential element for consistency across devices.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>&lt;building web for different devices&gt;</h3>
            <p>Based on the above-mentioned Responsive Design, it is prepared to be displayed correctly in various media, 
              and the size can be adjusted by setting CSS queries, layout, and maximum and minimum changes. 
              Furthermore, if necessary, there is a way to optimize it for other devices. For example, conditional expressions and queries
              can be added so that it can operate accordingly on other OSs, such as mobile interface and touch. Using a virtual testing tool,
              you can see how it looks. This can resolve any discrepancies that may arise due to use on different OSs. Additionally, 
              there may be a problem with the resolution being broken due to viewing on a larger screen, 
              which can be prevented by setting keywords such as background size and meta. This can solve the display problem.</p>
          </li>
         </ul>
          Lastly, to describe what I felt during this process, at first, I felt that it was very difficult because I had to use 
          defined functions as opposed to having to implement all the logic I had previously learned in C according to the procedures 
          using the language called JS. However, after using various functions, I got used to it and realized that this language 
          is a very flexible and simple language, and that many operations can be performed with low static memory consumption. 
          However, we implicitly realized that redirection time takes a long time and that ambiguity is very strong due to the nature of the language, 
          so it is widely used in items with few calculations, such as web design. Going through this course, 
          everything was new, but after learning these three processes one by one, I became familiar with them: defining commands, displayed characters, 
          and the arrangement of links on the web in HTML, decorating the design with CSS, and establishing rules with JS. Around that time, 
          I created a new web page &lpar;of course, the basic framework was based on the provided functions&rpar; 
          and learned various ways to include JS in HTML and the characteristics of each. I think it was a very meaningful time.
          What I felt was lacking while taking this course was the way to insert JS code according to the situation. 
          Sometimes, when running validation using user-defined tags in HTML in the form of a function &lpar;usually used when using a form&rpar;, 
          you can implement HTML directly in JS with innerhtml and use the necessary elements.
